                        <b>Spoiler Alert!! Please skip this one if you are planning on watching The Boys.</b><br>
                        The Boys, an Amazon Prime series that is based in a dystopian world where super heroes are motivated by popularity, public image and funding. In this world, super heroes are controlled by a monopolist company and the series is about how everything works in this kind of a (dark) world. Although it seemed like a different concept at the beginning, but personally it feels like if not for some adrenaline-filled scenes, the series isn't that great for me. The reason I brought up this post is to focus on some quotes that hit me hard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One character, a super hero, one of the rare gems who isn't aligned to the capitalistic view of the monopolist company, says: "Since when did hopeful become naive?". This quote hit me hard because I've seen people denigrate hope and to be honest, I've too done the same. So yeah, nothing more to say, the quote does the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second quote that hit me was: "If you jump ship and you let the assholes steer, then you're part of the problem". I see this one coming true almost everyday where people complain how their life sucks or how they wish someone should do it better than they are doing, etc. For an example, people complain about how dirty their city is, but not all of them throw their sauce sachets or tissue papers in the bin. In fact if you see someone littering and you haven't confronted that said person, the issue is with you too man!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll leave the best quote as the last one: "Since when has the world confused the word good with nice?".
                    </p>
