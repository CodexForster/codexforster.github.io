                    <p>
                        It was today I had my lab examination of an experiment that I had performed over the last 6 weeks. I was confident of my preparation for the viva and the demonstration. I believed I had covered all corners and gave it all the effort I could have.
                        <br>My examiner walked into the room and asked a colleague (who had a similar experiment) some questions, all of which I knew the answers to. My turn was next and I felt good and calm. But when I introduced him to my experiment and we had some discussions over it, he asked me one question: "If I increase the slit width, why do the spectral lines bulge/widen?" It was a simple yet an important question that I failed to answer.
                        To which he subtly replied "Think about it" and walked away. But think I could not, I went into a free fall for another couple of hours, filled with sadness over the fact that I couldn't answer an important question of an experiment I had been doing for 6 weeks. The question was practically there the whole time! The setup was simple and all I had to do was take a good look at the setup and ask why is this slit even there here? On the abstract I knew why, it seemed trivial then, but when I was asked to go deep into the why? I failed to do so, mainly because I didn't give it much importance during the 6 weeks I had.
                        <br>An experimentalist is one who first looks at his/her setup and knows where his/her errors would creep in, and focus on imporoving there. He/she would know the limits of the results one can obtain with their setup. Pushing it to great lengths is another topic altogether.
                        <br>An experimentalist is also one who tackles the simple but basic/important questions first. Once the conceptually crucial questions are sorted, he/she can proceed to the next step. Read on what you need to do first! and then start/jump to the fun experiments. Read and then play with questions, there should be a reason for every piece of your setup, why is it there and what does it help in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Happy learning! And until the next experimental screw up,
                        <br>Yours,
