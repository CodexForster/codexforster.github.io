                    <h2>What this website is for?</h2>
                    <p>To be completely honest, I made this website for two reasons. First, the idea of having my very own website on the internet
                        seemed like a fascinating idea. Second, I got myself to learn HTML5 and CSS, which is which is what I wanted through this pet-project of mine. The other reasons
                        are secondary ones, like having a place to write down my thoughts, which to be honest I don't think many would benefit from, but if it does, I couldn't be happier. Additionally, I apologise for the poor coding and if you
                        find any issues or want to make any changes, submit an issue or a pull request respectively, on my GitHub account.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why the name: Codex Forster?</h2>
                    <p>Codex Forster is one of Leonardo Da Vinci's notebooks and was once owned by writer and biographer, John Forster, hence the name. It consists of 3 volumes and 
                        The Codex Forster III consists of 94 sheets Leonardo's pocket notebooks of spontaneous, everyday notes and sketches. 
                        Leonardo used his sketches and drafts, but also ideas and thoughts, to record in bound sketchbooks and notebooks. It is reported that he always wore such a book on his belt [<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Forster">1</a>].
                        The work shows the remarkable diversity of Leonardo's interests and contains, among other things, drafts of fables and parables, as well as maps and city plans.
                        So symbolically this website is somewhat a notebook of mine where I will upload notes and afternotes of topics that intrigue me. Afternotes, because I wish to upload some
                        of them on Medium, and the informal gibberish of such Medium posts will be uploaded here. On an additional note, if you haven't read Walter Isaacson's The Genius Biographies, I highly recommend it.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Theme and Easter Eggs</h2>
                    <p>The orange-black theme on the home page is inspired from the McLaren F1 team colours, it just looked catchy on the car, I hope it does to you on the website. If I find anything better, I will update
                        the same.<br>
                        The font I used for "Codex Forster" is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sacramento?query=sacramento" target="blank">Sacramento</a>. One reason for choosing this font is that it is catchy, another subtler reason
                        is that it the city where The Mentalist is majorly shown to be taken in. And since I was watching the show to my likeness when I made this website, I thought it would be a nice poetic touch to add this font.<br>
                        The logo (which will be updated soon) is dedicated to the ones who were beside me on the morning of 06/01/2020.
